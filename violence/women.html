<p>Harassment covers a wide range of behaviours of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood
 as behaviour intended to disturb or upset, and it is characteristically repetitive. In the legal sense, it is intentional
  behaviour which is found threatening or disturbing. Sexual harassment refers to persistent and unwanted sexual advances, 
  typically in the workplace, where the consequences of refusing are potentially very disadvantageous to the victim.

     <h3 style="color:500BF1">Sexual harassment</h3>
 Sexual harassment is a violation of women's human rights and a prohibited form of violence against women in many countries.
 Sexually harassing conduct causes devastating physical and psychological injuries to a large percentage of women in workplaces
  around the world. Harassment directed against women in the workplace by their supervisors, fellow employees, or third parties 
  interferes with the integration of women in the workforce, reinforces the subordination of women to men in society, violates
   women's dignity and creates a health and safety hazard at work.

<h3 style="color:500BF1"> Cyber harassment</h3>

Cyber harassment and cyber stalking are often used synonymously to describe the actions of people who relentlessly pursue others
 online with the intention of frightening or embarrassing the victim. Sometimes a harasser intends to teach the victim a lesson or 
 solicit information from him or her, and stalkers generally want revenge or attention. Laws against this behavior vary depending 
 on the country, and victims should report their case to local authorities. To prevent crimes from occurring, it is important for 
 everyone to protect their identity while on the Internet.
