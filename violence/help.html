As you face the decision to either end the abusive relationship or try to save it, keep the following things in mind:<br>

    <p><div style="background-color: A19898"><b>If you're hoping your abusive partner will change...</b> The abuse will probably happen again. Abusers have deep emotional 
    and psychological problems. While change is not impossible, it isn't quick or easy. And change can only happen once your abuser
     takes full responsibility for his behavior, seeks professional treatment, and stops blaming you, his unhappy childhood, stress,
      work, his drinking, or his temper.<br>
      </div>
      </p>

<div style="background-color:A19898">
      <b>If you believe you can help your abuser...</b> It's only natural that you want to help your partner. You may think you are 
      the only one who understands him or that it’s your responsibility to fix his problems. But the truth is that by staying and
       accepting repeated abuse, you're reinforcing and enabling the abusive behavior. Instead of helping your abuser, you're 
       perpetuating the problem.<br>
       </div> </p>
       <p>
       <div style="background-color: A19898"><br/>
      <b>If your partner has promised to stop the abuse...</b> When facing consequences, abusers often plead for another chance,
       beg for forgiveness, and promise to change. They may even mean what they say in the moment, but their true goal is to stay 
       in control and keep you from leaving. But most of the time, they quickly return to their abusive behavior once they've been
        forgiven and theyre no longer worried that you'll leave.<br>
        </div> </p>
        <p><div style="background-color: A19898"><br/>
      <b>If your partner is in counseling or a program for batterers...</b> Even if your partner is in counseling, there is no
       guarantee that he'll change. Many abusers who go through counseling continue to be violent, abusive, and controlling. 
       If your partner has stopped minimizing the problem or making excuses, that’s a good sign. But you still need to make 
       your decision based on who he is now, not the man you hope he will become.<br>
       </div> </p>
       <p><div style="background-color: A19898"><br/>
      <b>If you're worried about what will happen if you leave... </b>You may be afraid of what your abusive partner will do,
       where you’ll go, or how you’ll support yourself or your children. But don’t let fear of the unknown keep you in a dangerous,
        unhealthy situation.
