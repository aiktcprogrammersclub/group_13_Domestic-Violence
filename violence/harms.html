<h1 style="font-style: italic;color:A19898">Causes</h1></center>
The causes of domestic violence are not made clear through research, but there are several factors that can result in 
violence. One of the most important is a belief that abuse, whether physical or verbal, is acceptable. Related to that,
 growing up in a violent home or living within a culture that accepts domestic violence are factors. Other factors are substance 
 abuse, unemployment, psychological problems, poor coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.

A common aspect among abusers is that they witnessed abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain
 of intergenerational cycles of domestic violence. That does not mean, conversely, that if a child witnesses or is subject
  to violence that they will become abusers. Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to 
  reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse

 </h3><h3 style="font-style: italic;color: E2265B">Biological and psychological</h3>
 These factors include genetics and brain dysfunction and are studied by neuroscience. Psychological theories focus on personality 
 traits and mental characteristics of the offender. Personality traits include sudden bursts of anger, poor impulse control,
  and poor self-esteem. Various theories suggest that psychopathology and other personality disorders are factors, and that abuse
   experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between juvenile delinquency 
   and domestic violence in adulthood. Studies have found high incidence of psychopathy among abusers. For 
   instance, some research suggests that about 80% of both court-referred and self-referred men in these domestic violence studies 
   exhibited diagnosable psychopathology, typically personality disorders.

 </h3><h3 style="font-style: italic;color: E2265B">Behavioral</h3>
 Behavioral theories draw on the work of behavior analysts. Applied behavior analysis uses the basic principles of learning 
 theory to change behavior. Behavioral theories of domestic violence focus on the use of functional assessment with the goal of 
 reducing episodes of violence to zero rates.This program leads to behavior therapy. Often by identifying the antecedents 
 and consequences of violent action, the abusers can be taught self control. Recently more focus has been placed on prevention
  and a behavioral prevention theory

<h3 style="font-style: italic;color: E2265B">On children</h3>
<div style="background-color: A19898">
3.3 million children witness domestic violence each year in the US. There has been an increase in acknowledgment that a child who 
is exposed to domestic abuse during their upbringing will suffer developmental and psychological damage.During the mid 1990s, 
the Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACE) found that children who were exposed to domestic violence and other forms of abuse had 
a higher risk of developing mental and physical health problems.[ Because of the awareness of domestic violence that some 
children have to face, it also generally impacts how the child develops emotionally, socially, behaviorally as well as cognitively.


Some emotional and behavioral problems that can result due to domestic violence include increased aggressiveness, anxiety, and
 changes in how a child socializes with friends, family, and authorities.Depression, emotional insecurity, and mental
  health disorders can follow due to traumatic experiences. Problems with attitude and cognition in schools can start 
  developing, along with a lack of skills such as problem-solving. Correlation has been found between the experience of 
  abuse and neglect in childhood and perpetrating domestic violence and sexual abuse in adulthood.

 <h3 style="font-style: italic;color: E2265B">Physical</h3>
 Bruises, broken bones, head injuries, lacerations, and internal bleeding are some of the acute effects of a domestic violence 
 incident that require medical attention and hospitalization.Some chronic health conditions that have been linked to victims
  of domestic violence are arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain, pelvic pain, ulcers, and migraines. Victims who 
  are pregnant during a domestic violence relationship experience greater risk of miscarriage, pre-term labor, and injury to or 
  death of the fetus

  <h3 style="font-style: italic;color: E2265B">Psychological</h3>
  victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely to meet the diagnostic 
  criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic 
  violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive 
  images, exaggerated startle response, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse.[260] These 
  symptoms are generally experienced for a long span of time after the victim has left the dangerous situation. Many researchers 
  state that PTSD is possibly the best diagnosis for those suffering from psychological effects of domestic violence, as it 
  accounts for the variety of symptoms commonly experienced by victims of trauma

   <h3 style="font-style: italic;color: E2265B">Financial</h3>
   In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are
    necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities 
    cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas. It has also been reported that one out of every 
    three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is 
    likely that her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face
     eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence.While the number of shelters and community 
     resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims
      seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.
